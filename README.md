# Sketched

## January 2023 Update: Database functionality (storing images) no longer works because the license for Google Cloud Datastore has expired ðŸ˜”

Sketched is a web application that allows users to upload or create drawings in-browser, on sticky notes, and tag them with a set of keywords. Once uploaded, users can search for keywords using a search bar and view all user-created and submitted drawings or images that contain that keyword, effectively establishing a crowdsourced image platform. In utilizing a drawing feature, we hope to restrict the amount of detail users can provide, in order to strip keywords down to their basic components; the drawings represent the big-picture idea of the keyword rather than focusing on minute details. In contrast, user-uploaded images serve to provide a more well-rounded visual description of the keyword.
Future plans include to create an organized file system to house our sticky notes, and create link-shareable sticky notes, and workspaces, wherein multiple people can contribute within the same folder.
